# Dragon Warrior ROM Patches

This directory contains IPS and BPS patch files that track differences between the original Dragon Warrior ROM and ROMs built with this project.

## Patch Files

- `dragon_warrior_modifications.ips` - IPS patch format (compatible with most ROM patchers)
- `dragon_warrior_modifications.bps` - BPS patch format (newer format with better compression)

## Usage

### Applying Patches

**IPS Patches:**
- Use any IPS patcher (Lunar IPS, Rom Patcher JS, etc.)
- Apply to original Dragon Warrior ROM

**BPS Patches:**
- Use beat, flips, or Rom Patcher JS
- Apply to original Dragon Warrior ROM

### Generating Patches

Patches are automatically generated by the build system when:
1. You have an original ROM file (`dragon_warrior.nes` or similar)
2. You build a modified ROM using the asset pipeline
3. The build system detects differences between original and built ROM

```bash
# Manual patch generation
python tools/patch_generator.py dragon_warrior.nes output/dragon_warrior_modified.nes
```

## Why Track Patches?

- **Version Control**: Track exact changes made to game data
- **Distribution**: Share modifications without distributing copyrighted ROM files  
- **Debugging**: Identify what changed between builds
- **Collaboration**: Other developers can see your modifications

## Important Notes

- Original ROM files are **not** stored in this repository
- Only patch files (differences) are tracked in git
- This respects copyright while preserving modification history
- Users must provide their own legal ROM files
