# Dragon Warrior Info - Development Logs Index

This directory contains development session logs, chat logs, and meta-documentation about the project development process.

## 📝 About These Logs

These logs document the **development process** of creating the Dragon Warrior disassembly and ROM hacking toolkit. They are distinct from the project documentation (which describes how to use the tools) and instead focus on how the tools were built.

## 📚 Directory Structure

### Chat Logs (`chat-logs/`)

Detailed conversation logs from development sessions, including:

- Design discussions
- Problem-solving sessions
- Feature planning
- Implementation decisions

**Available Chat Logs:**

- [2024-11-27: Comprehensive Label Expansion](chat-logs/2024-11-27_comprehensive-label-expansion.md)
- [2024-11-27: Label Expansion Session 2](chat-logs/2024-11-27_label-expansion-session2.md)
- [2025-11-18: Chat Log](chat-logs/CHAT_LOG_2025-11-18.md)

### Session Logs (`session-logs/`)

Summaries of development sessions, including:

- Objectives and goals
- Work completed
- Code changes made
- Next steps and planning

**Available Session Logs:**

- [2024-11-27: Comprehensive Label Expansion Session](session-logs/2024-11-27_comprehensive-label-expansion-session.md)
- [2024-11-27: Label Expansion Continuation](session-logs/2024-11-27_label-expansion-continuation.md)

### Manual Prompt Log

- [Manual Prompt Log](manual%20prompt%20log.txt) - Raw prompt history and manual notes

## 🎯 Purpose

These logs serve multiple purposes:

1. **Historical Record** - Track the evolution of the project
2. **Knowledge Transfer** - Help new contributors understand design decisions
3. **Pattern Recognition** - Identify successful approaches for future work
4. **Accountability** - Document what was accomplished in each session
5. **Learning Resource** - Show real-world ROM hacking development process

## 📊 Development Timeline

This project has been developed through multiple focused sessions:

- **November 2024** - Initial disassembly work and label expansion
- **Assembly Code Quality** - Systematic improvement of label clarity
- **Tool Development** - Creation of extraction and modification tools
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive guide and reference documentation

## 🤝 Contributing to Logs

When adding new development logs:

1. **Chat Logs** - Save complete conversation transcripts with date prefix
2. **Session Logs** - Create summaries with objectives, outcomes, and next steps
3. **Naming Convention** - Use format: `YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive-name.md`
4. **Update This Index** - Add new logs to the appropriate section above
