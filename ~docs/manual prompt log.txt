use the FFMQ SNES disassembly project as a reference for project management, not data or code as it is obviously a different game, website at `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info/` and git project at `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info.git` and locally at `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ffmq-info`; use `.editorconfig` for formatting and format every file (tabs not spaces, lowercase hexadecimal); create a venv sandboxed python environment; create github issues (ref ffmq project for github python scipts) using github project and kanban board `https://github.com/users/TheAnsarya/projects/5/views/1`; when planning or making new un-planned work, always create githuib issues and todo lists; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown log files
The goal is full documentation of the game as markdown files and a `data crystal` style wikitext structure documenting the entire game's rom structure (in abstract, and exact) and ROM map and SRAM map and hacking information; create hacking tools (asset editing tools) and extract all assets for editing, and then tools to reinsert those assets during the build process; oh yeah, a full build pipeline; basically, make this project awesome but without adding nonsense and use up the token space, don't waste my money, go as long as you can, but creating git commits as you go and updating github issues as you go, and updating logs, etc.;

create the scripts (see reference in ffmq) for building the source code, using the extracted/reinserted assets, not just using `db` databank declarations, that compares to the reference rom which is at `\~roms\Dragon Warrior (U) (PRG1) [!].nes` (use the PRG1 version, not the PRG0 version) and create reports with the exact percentage and which parts match,  

git comment each effort with descriptions and push; you hit an error `Sorry, the response hit the length limit. Please rephrase your prompt.` so make smaller replies or whatever you have to do to not hit this error; go back to: create the scripts (see reference in ffmq) for building the source code, using the extracted/reinserted assets, not just using `db` databank declarations, that compares to the reference rom which is at `\~roms\Dragon Warrior (U) (PRG1) [!].nes` (use the PRG1 version, not the PRG0 version) and create reports with the exact percentage and which parts match,  

git comment and push; now, augment the asset exrtaction-edit-reinsert pipeline with json files for the dat structures (levels, stores, maps, monsters, etc) and graphics and palettes (into png files), and maps; create editors using the edit-level asset files for world map, town and dungeon maps, stores, monster stats, dialog, font, graphics, items, spells, etc.

I noticed in `tools\extraction\data_extractor.py` it's using `sample data` I don't want sample data, I want all of this extracted from the rom; this applies to all of the editors and data structures and data extractors and asset extractors

git comment and push; format all files using .editorconfig especially TABS NOT SPACE ALWAYS AND FOREVER; and continue cleanup and asset management

The `~roms` folder and `venv` folder should be in `.gitignore` and should not be affected by formatting; revert thos venv files you just changed and then continue formatting the main project

asset files that are created like `graphics_data.asm` don't seem to be referenced anywhere, so how are they being using used in the build process? it seems like the original data is still used in the ROM build process; fix this

don't have the build system modify the main source files, but rather use assembly includes of the asset files and move the data in the main assembly files into a default include folder of asset files or something;

git comment and push; The `venv` python virtual environment is in gitignore, but make sure it is in the setup instructions and keep the `requirements.txt` file updated, and whatever else should be properly available for venv to make it easy to use; don't commit the built ROM to git, so add it to gitignore (without any edits it should compile to the original copyrighted rom, so we don't want itin the repos); then recheck the asset editors to make sure they are editing the extracted assets, not editing the source code or rom directly; if the built rom does not match the reference build rom, then create an `.ips` patch and `.bps` patch that is included in git so the differences can be tracked; build the rom from assets and such;

automatically create some timestamped patch files in `ips` and `bps` format during every ROM file build process

The primary reference rom is `roms\Dragon Warrior (U) (PRG1) [!].nes` document this and use this

verify that the built rom matches the reference roms and create reports that show the matching progress and what matches and what doesn't; 

selecting options is by number only so `10` not `10. clean build`;

git comment and push; `extract assets from rom` is failing; make that work and the other build pipeline options all work as expected; verification reports are using space instead of tabs, we only use tabs for indentation, never spaces, fix that;

Don't forget to use my documentation on Dragon Warrior in our github repos at `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/GameInfo/tree/main/Dragon%20Warrior%20(NES)`; and verify the asset extraction/reinsertion pipeline

I added the `GameInfo` project to the workspace; please update the wikitext files for Dragon Warrior 1 and add structure and more files in the milieu of FFMQ for `Dragon Warrior 1 (NES)` based on the disassembly and doumentation; all of the extyracted asset `png` files are blank empty black squares, use the palettes that are applied to each monster/player/npc/background-tile has colors it actually uses in the png file exraction/reinsertion process;

Add a link to `https://hexed.it/` (`HexEd.it`) (and add a desctiption) to the referenece documentation as a resource for editing hex files directly; git comment and push, all projects with descriptions, do it in batches of reklated files;

git comment and push everything that is uncommited!; the png asset extraction is still garbage; concentrate on extracting the text font (in aggregate) as a valid png file that I can view and edit as it displays on screen during play; then maybe work on extracting the slime monster graphics as displayed for easy editing, so use the palettes used by that enemy (blue/white/red) during extraction/insertion so we can use this as an example;

show me the dialog font json files and png files

extract all of that now! (`dragon_warrior_font_complete.png` doesn't exist)
PRG1, not PRG0! PRG0 is the alternate not the primary
text graphics as they should be are in `C:\Users\me\source\repos\GameInfo\Dragon Warrior (NES)\Wiki\Images` fix the font extraction so it matches something like this
no, DW text is white on black, I don't know what you're looking at, font is like `C:\Users\me\source\repos\GameInfo\Dragon Warrior (NES)\Wiki\Images\Dragon Warrior (NES) - Text Table in RAM - 2.png` this extracted font is garbage; stop giving me nonsense, fix it, damnit!;
t give a shit about the colors, the font DOES 
NOT MATCH; fix the font fix the font fix the font;
No you did not, what shit, you're talking about addresses that are one byte long, that's insane, gove me an extracted font png and json that actually uses the real font from the actual rom

All of the extracted graphics are incorrect, please find the correct extraction addresses (remember, NES addresses are different from file addresses) and create png files that actually look like the graphics used in the game

The disassembly shows where graphics are and we have a graphics extraction pipeline, fix that and run it; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;

git comment and push everything that is uncommited!; that only extracted two monsters, where are the rest? Also those two monsters are incorrect; Is the disassembly building the PRG1 version of the rom (which we are using as reference) or the PRG0 version of rom? What is the build comparing to and does the build properly match PRG1?; make sure the code matches the rom version we're using and then fix the asset extraction pipeline and addresses; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;

git comment and push everything that is uncommited!; continue your work! thank you! please make all of our extracted graphics and data are accurate; fix the disassembly so it outputs PRG1 not PRG0 (you said it was 3 bytes difference?) or was a compiler switch with an #ifdef that defaults to PRG1 (as long as it doesn't move code and data around, but rather just replaces some code in-place); implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;

git comment and push everything that is uncommited!; update and make your todo-ists and github issues; continue your work! thank you! please make all of our extracted graphics and data accurate; those are too many files, we don't need an individual png file for every single 8x8 tile, instead group them by purpose (red slime/overworld bg tiles/overworld map background water tiles/Kol background town tiles/npcs/hero/menu borders/text/etc); make the graphics are accurate; make sure the data (like monster stats, item stats, magic effects, etc) are all accurate and extracted correctly; continue your previous work!; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;

git comment and push everything that is uncommited!; update and make your todo-ists and github issues; continue your work! thank you! please make all of our extracted graphics and data accurate; those are too many files, we don't need an individual png file for every single 8x8 tile, instead group them by purpose into single ong files (so not one per 8x8 tile, but rather all of red slime in one file or all of monsters in one file or both or whatever) (like put alkl of the town background files in a file, or some other good grouping, so we don't have a thousand files to extract, process, edit, and re-insert), maybe by CHR-bank, I don't know, just make it intuitive and easy to update (red slime/overworld bg tiles/overworld map background water tiles/Kol background town tiles/npcs/hero/menu borders/text/etc); make the graphics are accurate; make sure the data (like monster stats, item stats, magic effects, etc) are all accurate and extracted correctly; continue your previous work!; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;

git comment and push everything that is uncommited!; You said `monster_sprites - 64 tiles - All enemy monster sprites (64 different monsters)` but there are (also according to you) there are 39 monsters and they use way more than 64 sprites? this all seems suspect; fix it; also create a big todo-list/steps for manual checking of all the data and graphics and editors, etc, and places/instructions for me to place screen shots of the game to help verify extraction and re-insertion; create a plan for a complete single editor (with tabs), so extraction of data with correct addresses into binary data files, which are the transformed to editable assets (json, png, etc) and then editors (a single editor ui/script) for those assets, then re-tranformation into new different binary data files, then included in the code during the build pipeline process; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;

git comment and push everything that is uncommited!; continue!; implement the changes to make it awesome for as long as you can and use up all the tokens for each session, do not waste my money - use the entire token space;
