use the FFMQ SNES disassembly project as a reference for project management, not data or code as it is obviously a different game, website at `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info/` and git project at `https://github.com/TheAnsarya/ffmq-info.git` and locally at `C:\Users\me\source\repos\ffmq-info`; use `.editorconfig` for formatting and format every file (tabs not spaces, lowercase hexadecimal); create a venv sandboxed python environment; create github issues (ref ffmq project for github python scipts) using github project and kanban board `https://github.com/users/TheAnsarya/projects/5/views/1`; when planning or making new un-planned work, always create githuib issues and todo lists; and update them as you complete work; always create session logs in `~docs\session-logs` and ai chat logs at `~docs\chat-logs\` as markdown log files
The goal is full documentation of the game as markdown files and a `data crystal` style wikitext structure documenting the entire game's rom structure (in abstract, and exact) and ROM map and SRAM map and hacking information; create hacking tools (asset editing tools) and extract all assets for editing, and then tools to reinsert those assets during the build process; oh yeah, a full build pipeline; basically, make this project awesome but without adding nonsense and use up the token space, don't waste my money, go as long as you can, but creating git commits as you go and updating github issues as you go, and updating logs, etc.;

create the scripts (see reference in ffmq) for building the source code, using the extracted/reinserted assets, not just using `db` databank declarations, that compares to the reference rom which is at `\~roms\Dragon Warrior (U) (PRG1) [!].nes` (use the PRG1 version, not the PRG0 version) and create reports with the exact percentage and which parts match,  

git comment each effort with descriptions and push; you hit an error `Sorry, the response hit the length limit. Please rephrase your prompt.` so make smaller replies or whatever you have to do to not hit this error; go back to: create the scripts (see reference in ffmq) for building the source code, using the extracted/reinserted assets, not just using `db` databank declarations, that compares to the reference rom which is at `\~roms\Dragon Warrior (U) (PRG1) [!].nes` (use the PRG1 version, not the PRG0 version) and create reports with the exact percentage and which parts match,  

git comment and push; now, augment the asset exrtaction-edit-reinsert pipeline with json files for the dat structures (levels, stores, maps, monsters, etc) and graphics and palettes (into png files), and maps; create editors using the edit-level asset files for world map, town and dungeon maps, stores, monster stats, dialog, font, graphics, items, spells, etc.

I noticed in `tools\extraction\data_extractor.py` it's using `sample data` I don't want sample data, I want all of this extracted from the rom; this applies to all of the editors and data structures and data extractors and asset extractors

git comment and push; format all files using .editorconfig especially TABS NOT SPACE ALWAYS AND FOREVER; and continue cleanup and asset management

The `~roms` folder and `venv` folder should be in `.gitignore` and should not be affected by formatting; revert thos venv files you just changed and then continue formatting the main project

asset files that are created like `graphics_data.asm` don't seem to be referenced anywhere, so how are they being using used in the build process? it seems like the original data is still used in the ROM build process; fix this

don't have the build system modify the main source files, but rather use assembly includes of the asset files and move the data in the main assembly files into a default include folder of asset files or something;

git comment and push; The `venv` python virtual environment is in gitignore, but make sure it is in the setup instructions and keep the `requirements.txt` file updated, and whatever else should be properly available for venv to make it easy to use; don't commit the built ROM to git, so add it to gitignore (without any edits it should compile to the original copyrighted rom, so we don't want itin the repos); then recheck the asset editors to make sure they are editing the extracted assets, not editing the source code or rom directly; if the built rom does not match the reference build rom, then create an `.ips` patch and `.bps` patch that is included in git so the differences can be tracked; build the rom from assets and such;

automatically create some timestamped patch files in `ips` and `bps` format during every ROM file build process

The primary reference rom is `roms\Dragon Warrior (U) (PRG1) [!].nes` document this and use this

verify that the built rom matches the reference roms and create reports that show the matching progress and what matches and what doesn't; 

selecting options is by number only so `10` not `10. clean build`;

git comment and push; `extract assets from rom` is failing; make that work and the other build pipeline options all work as expected; verification reports are using space instead of tabs, we only use tabs for indentation, never spaces, fix that;
